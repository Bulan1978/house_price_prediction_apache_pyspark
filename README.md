# house_price_prediction_apache_pyspark
Used apache pyspark instead of python pandas
I found this project in kaggle and recreated it using Google colaboratory. The spark, pyspark and java installations were done in the Google Colab drive, which eliminated any requirement of local workstation istallation.
