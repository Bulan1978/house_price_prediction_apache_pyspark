# house_price_prediction_apache_pyspark
Used apache pyspark instead of python pandas
I found this project in kaggle and recreated it using Google colaboratory. The spark, pyspark and java installations were done in the Google Colab drive, which eliminated any requirement of local workstation installation.

- Challenges faced :

  • High multi-collinearity between several predictor variables which was handled by elstic net model of liner regression.
  
  • Independent variables were very widely distributed which required standardization of data.
  
- Tools / techniques used :

  • Google colab along with pyspark libraries, visualization libraries matplotlib and seaborn.
  
  • Techniques include preprocessing with preprocessing, feature transformation, data standardization by StandardScaler, study of visualization graphs, model building and evaluation based on regression metrics.
  
- Model Selection :

  • Elastic Net Linear Regression evaluated on the basis of metrics like R-squared, MAE and RMSE.
    
- Project outcome :
  
  • Machine learning regression model to predict home prices for buying and sellng, without the help of external assessors.
